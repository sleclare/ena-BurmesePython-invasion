The aim of this code is to understand how the establishment of the Burmese python effects the native Everglades food-web. 
To accomplish this we integrated the Burmese python into a pre-existing trophic network constructed prior to the large scale establishment of the aforementioned species and used established ecological network 
metrics from enaR and the cheddar package to conduct two types of analyses: A comparative analysis between the original and python integrated networks and a descriptive analysis of the niche space the python is
occupying within the trophic network. Here is the R code used to run analyses and generate results for the research article:
